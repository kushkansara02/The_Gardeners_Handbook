# canHACK-Project-The-Gardener-s-Handbook
There is no doubt that the pandemic has affected the health and state of mind of many Canadians. For that, we have created The Gardener's Handbook, an app for Canadians to track the growth of their plants as well as their emotions after spending time outdoors.

Gardening reaps environmental benefits as well. Non-local products in stores travel an average of 1500 miles or further. The shipping and transport associated burns fossil fuels, which produce greenhouse gases that increase global warming. When you follow the sustainability tips in The Gardener’s Handbook, such as using relatively small amounts with little or no pesticides or synthetic chemicals, you create a more environmentally friendly environment.

The Gardener’s Handbook is built on a web framework using Django. HTML and CSS were used for the app’s front-end development and python used for its back-end development.

The next steps for this project is to transform our website into a mobile app. In terms of features, we would implement a calendar using JavaScript. Additionally, we would implement a feature that would allow users to share a family code and sync their accounts, which will ensure the plants listed under “My Plants” and allow families to work of the same calendar for their garden.
